# Electricity-Billing-System
 
## Overview 
*This is my Academic group project which I have done as a summer internship projects under my first year of graduation.*

Language used - `Java`

Concept used - `Swings`

IDE used - `Eclipse IDE 2019-20`

Database used - `MS Access 2016`


## Introduction
This project aims to provide a digital, convenient and user friendly method of paying and viewing electricity bills. The existing system is manual and cumbersome, and because of its dependency on human factor, is more prone to errors. Here we aim to provide a convenient and efficient digital alternative for the same, so as to improve customer satisfaction as well as increase efficiency, and reduce margin of error due to human factor.
This project has additional ‘mail and feedback’ facility where user can get mail for successful registration or to get reciept of bill payment and can also give feedback, which are not their in the existing Electricity Billing Project.

## Features of the Proposed System-
The aim of this project is to develop an effective electricity billing application that computerizes the bill calculation, viewing, and payment process. It is meant to provide an easy to navigate user interface and thus improve the billing process overall, as well as minimize human dependency so as to minimize the margin of error in the process. 
The application should act as an intermediary between the database/payment gateways and the user, ensuring data protection and user satisfaction.

## Objectives of the Proposed System
●	To provide a computer-based billing system for an accurate computation of Bills.

●	To maintain customer records, including customer’s personal information as well as billing details.

●	To allow administrator control over records via same interface without compromising data security.

●	To provide a secured and protected account for private information inside the organization.

●	To lessen the time, energy, and resources that was being consumed when performing a billing for the customers.

●	To maintain, update and view customer’s electricity billing information easily.

●	To provide easy access to records and payment option.

●	To provide the service of receipt generation.

## Future Scope
The current version of this application has many essential features. However, development projects always have room for improvement. The code is easily modifiable and has a lot of potential for future improvements. 
With better resources, both human and technical, the following features may be implemented:

i.	A payment gateway, in place of the dummy window.

ii.	A centralized database, so that the application can be run on any Windows PC.

iii.	Billing options for HT Commercial Electricity Tariff can be included. 

iv.	Expanding the application’s capabilities to include other states’ electricity tariffs.

v.	Wallet can be developed to handle discounts on the points basis.

vi.	The backup mechanism for database on regular basis.
